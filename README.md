# Bruce Markham's Resume

## üëÄ Check It Out

See it live at: https://brucificus.io/curriculum-vitae

Or check out the underyling plain text at [./src/data](https://github.com/brucificus/curriculum-vitae/tree/master/src/data).

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Why I Did It This Way

I built my resume in Gatsby because I thought it would help solve the problem of keeping the _presentation_ of my resume separate from the _content_.

Or maybe I did it because TypeScript and Markdown are more fun than Word documents. You choose the explanation you like better.

Anywho, this also theoretically opens the door on using cool web development tricks to make my resume be more attractive‚Ä¶ right after that next project.

## üí° Contributing

If you suspect you've got a cool suggestion for how this could be better, file a constructively-presented issue or pull request - I'd love to hear from you!

## üéì Learn Gatsby for Yourself

Looking for guidance on how to build something like this? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, they recommend starting with their [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to their documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
